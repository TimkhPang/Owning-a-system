# Owning-a-System: Post-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation Simulation

This project simulates the post-exploitation phase of a cybersecurity attack, focusing on maintaining access, escalating privileges, and cracking sensitive passwords on a compromised system. Utilizing tools like John the Ripper and leveraging virtualization platforms such as Microsoft Azure and Hyper-V, this exercise demonstrates the methodologies employed by attackers to fortify their foothold within a target environment.
